# Liquid Staking

The Liquid Staking Telebase app enables users to deposit ETH into Lido before its peggyed on the SIDE chain. This allows users to obtain rewards from both Lido and the SIDE chain. This app only works on ethereum for now.

In this app, the vault is a contract controlled by the TSS network.
